# Contributing to [APPLICATION_NAME]

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing!

The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can contribute and explain how we accept contribution.

# Reporting issues
Please use [official Snyk support website](https://support.snyk.io) to report any issues. Our technical support team will work together with you to resolve an issue, or pass it on to our engineers for resolution.

You can find recommended information to include in the ticket on the [technical support guide page](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/5930557657885-Snyk-Technical-Support-Guide).

# Providing feedback or suggestions
Similarly to bug reports, we accept improvement suggestions and feedback via [the official support website](https://support.snyk.io).

Please refer to the [support knowledge base](https://support.snyk.io/) and [user docs](https://docs.snyk.io) to verify that your suggestion isn't already part of our product before submitting a ticket with us.

# Contributing code changes
We are thrilled that you are interested in contributing code changes! Because this project is part of Snyk’s overall software offering, we want to make sure that your contribution aligns with our vision and product strategy, so please reach out to us before submitting a pull request. If you’re thinking of contributing a new feature, contact [our support](https://support.snyk.io) with a detailed explanation of your planned contribution and we'll be happy to discuss it with you. If you’re thinking of contributing a bug fix, we’d still like you to raise a support ticket first, as it’s possible we may already be working on a fix.

Once we've confirmed that we're ready to accept your contribution, feel free to open a pull request and link it in the support ticket. We're excited to work with you to get your contribution merged and make our project even better!

## Contributor License Agreement
As part of the PR process, you'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). It is an automated process and you'll only need to do it once, when contributing first time. You won't need to sign it in future when contributing to other Snyk projects.

## Pipeline checks
We don't allow external contributors to run pipeline status checks on your PR for security reasons. We'll run them on your behalf when you mark your PR changes as ready for us.

## Code of Conduct
Please make sure to read and follow the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).
